The cbe_init component creates a fresh CBE device (virtual block device,
free tree and superblocks) on a back-end block-device according to the
configured parameters. On success, the component exits with exit value 0,
otherwise with exit value -1.


Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is an example configuration of the component which shows the default
value for each attribute except 'config.dst_ip' and 'config.interface':

! <config>
!    <virtual-block-device
!       nr_of_levels="4"
!       nr_of_children="64"
!       nr_of_leafs="8192" />
!
!    <free-tree
!       nr_of_levels="3"
!       nr_of_children="64"
!       nr_of_leafs="1024" />
! </config>

This is a short description of the tags and attributes:

:config.virtual-block-device:
  Mandatory. Contains parameters for the tree that represents the virtual
  block device.

:config.virtual-block-device.nr_of_levels:
  Mandatory. Number of tree levels including the leafs and the root.

:config.virtual-block-device.nr_of_children:
  Mandatory. The tree degree or number of children for each inner node of the
  tree.

:config.virtual-block-device.nr_of_leafs:
  Mandatory. The number of leafs of the tree that are used. This defines the
  number of virtual blocks available to the CBE device. This number must be
  less or equal the number of leafs of the tree, which results from the number
  of tree levels and the tree degree.

:config.free-tree:
  Mandatory. Contains parameters for the tree that is used for managing the
  spare blocks of the CBE device.

:config.free-tree.nr_of_levels:
  Mandatory. Number of tree levels including the leafs and the root.

:config.free-tree.nr_of_children:
  Mandatory. The tree degree or number of children for each inner node of the
  tree.

:config.free-tree.nr_of_leafs:
  Mandatory. The number of leafs of the tree that are used. This defines the
  number of spare blocks available to the CBE device. This number must be less
  or equal the number of leafs of the tree, which results from the number of
  tree levels and the tree degree.


Sessions

This is an overview of the sessions required and provided by the
component apart from the environment sessions:

* Requires one Block session.
